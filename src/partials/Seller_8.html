Friends and clients,

{{#if version-A}}
Should you sell your home during the winter? Or should you take your property off of the market until after the holidays?

Most people say that you should sell during the spring. Traditionally in {{market}}, more homes sell during the spring and summer months. However, the other thing to consider is that more people are selling their homes during those seasons. If you wait for spring, you will face more competition.

By selling this winter, you can avoid the rush of new listings that hit the market in spring. There tends to be lower inventory in the winter, which could increase your home’s value.

Also, contrary to popular belief, this time of year is great for selling homes. Homes show very well when they are decorated for the holiday season. Buyers will see how beautiful your home is during the winter and imagine their own future holidays there with their own family.

Not only that, buyers that are out looking in the snow are serious about finding a home. Many people this time of year are being relocated for their jobs and need to be settled in by January 1st. Others may need to buy before the new year for tax reasons.

If you wait until spring, you will run into a lot more looky-loos. Those people are planning on buying in the summer, when the kids are out of school, but just feel like wandering through open houses in the meantime. Waiting for spring also means missing out on those serious winter buyers.

That said, some buyers are worried about arranging their holiday schedules around home showings. Don’t worry; you can absolutely restrict showings. Buyers understand that you have family commitments just like they do. As long as you provide advanced notice of which days you cannot hold showings, {{#if single-agent}}I{{else}}We{{/if}}’ve found that everything will work out fine.

Finally, selling this time of year allows you to become a non-contingent buyer in the spring. More inventory will come on the market, which means home values will drop. Basically, selling in the winter provides a wonderful opportunity for you to sell high and buy low.

Ultimately, the best time of year to sell your home is when you need to sell. If that happens to be this winter, {{#if single-agent}}I{{else}}we{{/if}} can sit down with you and work out a marketing plan to net you the most money.

You’ve probably heard about the spring and summer “selling seasons” in real estate. While traditionally in {{market}}, more homes do sell during that time, the selling season never truly stops.

In fact, what most people won’t tell you is that you’ll actually face less competition when selling in the fall and winter months. Contrary to what some might have you believe, not every buyer is looking to make their move during the summer to get things settled before the the school year starts.

Not only will you face less competition in the winter, you’ll find more serious buyers. You won’t have to worry about summer buyers just wandering through open houses in the spring, and you know a buyer willing to house hunt in the snow is a serious buyer!

Remember, many buyers like relocated workers are also looking to buy before the new year for tax purposes, and want to get that purchase made before January.

{{#if single-agent}}I{{else}}We{{/if}}’ve even had many instances when {{#if single-agent}}I{{else}}we{{/if}}’ve recommended homeowners sell in the winter because their home showed better with snow and holiday decorations around.

And if you have some flexibility, selling in the winter allows you to become on non-contingent buyer in the spring, when competition heats up for sellers, and drives prices down. It’s the best chance to sell high and buy low.

Do you know what your home is worth right now? The first step to selling is knowing what you can expect to get from your home sale. For an accurate valuation, [use {{#if single-agent}}my{{else}}our{{/if}} free home value tool]({{homeval}}).
