Friends and clients,

{{#if version-A}}
There are many things to do before you sell your property. {{#if single-agent}}I{{else}}We{{/if}} highly recommend staging your home before it hits the market and for home showings.

Home staging simply presents your home in its best light. {{#if single-agent}}I{{else}}We{{/if}} {{# if offerstaging }}offer a free staging service that{{else}}know many local expert home stagers who{{/if}} can position your property to sell for top dollar in today’s market.

Most people think that staging their home means buying all new furniture and completely redecorating the property. That is not the case. Home stagers use what you have in the home and rearrange a few things to make your property seem more spacious.

If you have a bulky dresser or large cabinet, you may need to put that in the garage until your property sells. Home stagers work to make sure your property feels large, light, and airy in order to entice today’s buyers. Of course, you may be able to get away with relocating certain pieces of furniture into different rooms.

Decluttering is an important part of home staging. Extra stuff laying around is not appealing to the eye. Clear off countertops. Put things that you don’t need into storage. These simple steps alone will make your home seem larger.

Removing personal items also allows the buyer to envision themselves in your property. Take down things like personal photos, trinkets, and knick-knacks.

Sometimes, home stagers may recommend a fresh coat of neutral paint in a room. Again, the goal is to make the home seem light and neutral. You don’t want buyers to get distracted by a bright green wall and pass on your home.

Staging a home can cost around $675, depending on the size of the property. However, this investment is worth it.{{/if}} Studies show that staged homes tend to sell faster and for more money than unstaged homes. Increasing your home’s value before you put your property on the market couldn’t hurt!

Once the home is staged, {{#if single-agent}}I{{else}}we{{/if}} also recommend bringinging in a professional photographer. Most home buyers begin their search online. Having the best photographs of your home posted on the MLS will draw the right buyers to see your home in person.

Staging doesn’t have to mean a total overhaul of rented furniture; a good {{agent}} can give you tips for using your own things to make your home show at its best. As {{#if single-agent}}an expert{{else}}experts{{/if}} in the {{market}} market, {{#if single-agent}}I{{else}}we{{/if}} know the tastes and trends of buyers, which allows {{#if single-agent}}me{{else}}us{{/if}} to tap into the their wants with your home.

To really make your home stand out, use professional photography to showcase your home online. In today’s market, more than 90% of buyers start their home search online, where you have just a few seconds to make an impression.

Dark, grainy, and poorly-shot photos can be the difference in a buyer deciding whether or not they even want to see your home.
