Friends and clients,

{{#if version-A}}
When it comes down to it, there are five universal factors that affect a home's value, whether the home is in {{market}} or halfway across the country.

It all starts with location, location, location. Home values are determined by neighborhoods and what similar homes in the neighborhood have sold for. This is what real estate agents mean when you hear them refer to "comps."

In addition to the neighborhood and the value of surrounding homes, things like school district and proximity to amenities have a huge impact on a home's value. Due to all the variables that go into location, you truly need a professional to help you pinpoint the value of your home.

Likewise, future location also plays a huge role in the value of your home. What's trending in your city or your neighborhood? What kind of development have you seen recently, whether that's residential or commercial development? Remember, future value changes based on location can also mean property tax changes.

The one thing most homeowners don't realize has a bigger impact on the value of their home than they think is the condition of the market. You may be aware that low inventory in your area gives you more value, but did you know interest rates have a direct impact on the buying power of potential buyers?

When rates are low, buying power is high, and buyers can afford to spend a lot more on a home. The inverse is true as well. Market conditions are not universal though, which is why it's so important to enlist the help of a professional to gauge the market’s condition in your area.

Another important factor that often gets overlooked when it comes to the value of your home is zoning changes. Residential and suburban areas aren't affected quite as much as metropolitan and downtown areas. It's especially important to keep an eye on zoning changes in these areas, especially if you're seeing changes in areas near you.

Finally, and probably most obviously, is a home's condition. It's simply amazing how much more buyers are willing to pay for a home in good condition that shows well, with simple things like clean baseboards, clutter-free rooms, and brightness. The three most important rooms are the kitchen, the master bedroom, and the master bathroom. They should be in top condition, with cleared countertops, and sparkling-clean surfaces and fixtures.

Of course, each individual home has dozens of factors that influence its value. The best way to truly find an accurate value for your home is with a {{agent}} who makes a living finding accurate values for a home.

There are five major factors that influence the value of your home. Some are out of your control, some change with the market, and some are all up to you.

In the {{market}} market, it all starts with location, location, location. Appraisers and your agent alike will use similar properties in your area to determine what your home is worth - what {{#if single-agent}}I{{else}}we{{/if}} refer to as "comps." Location also factors in things like proximity to amenities, or on the other side, proximity to undesirable things like busy streets or power lines.

Location alone has numerous variables that affect value. Future location is another factor; what will your area look like in the next five, 10, and 20 years? Similarly, zoning laws and changes can have a huge impact on value in the not-so-distant future.

Condition of the market is an overlooked factor in your home's value. Homeowners often think that value doesn't change, but what the market is willing to pay for your home is truly its value. When interest rates are low like they are currently, buying power goes up, and so does your home's value.

Finally, condition of your home is a huge factor in determining value. Today's buyers are much more attracted to move-in ready homes that show well, thanks to being clean, bright, and well-staged.
